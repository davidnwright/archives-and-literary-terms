**The importance of the text. These kits do not exist in a vacuum. They need a text to build on, represent, speak to.**

**Note:** This is part I of a series. This is the first of the archive series. There's a board game series and a intersections series too--check the "index" to find out more. 

As with the other kits in this series, I'm not here to engage forcefully with the entrenched theories and practices of the disciplines (in this case, probably archival / museum studies), I'll leave that to the experts, many of whom I refer to in the big picture statement that governs this site. That said, the opportunities for thinking about the exhibit as a model, or even a physical space, for understanding figurative language, intertextuality, metonymy, synecdoche, and other, let's call them second-level literary terms, is intriguing.

The exhibit is, within fairly narrow parameters, a collection of media--or records, documentation--providing information about a place, institution, or group of people; or even more simply, the exhibit is a space where something is placed with other things--a collection for display. This concept of the exhibit fulfills many of the definitional requirements of the literary terms listed above: it stands in for a whole, its smaller parts are exhibits within exhibits, it represents an institution (the university, say), but also a life lived and, it shows in numerous media formats and genres--drafts, letters, pictures, diaries, notes, doodles, radio programs, films, an almost endless array of other materials and documents. Furthermore, each item in an exhibit has its own potential attachments outside the exhibit in which it is presented. 

Like symbols under literary analysis, items in an exhibit are locked to the exhibit itself, but might also take on a more universal representation over time or within certain cultural contexts or literary texts--a dagger for MacBeth is not the dagger for Brutus; a rose for Shakespeare is not quite the same as for Gertrude Stein. Depending on how one displays roses and daggers, hopefully less awkwardly than I am doing here, their deeper meaning, symbolism, metaphor, and how they plays with the same figurative understanding of the other items nearby becomes an open question. 

The drive of the kit, again impeded somewhat by my demand that they be physical or material in nature, is to provide materials for building an exhibit. The kit should encourage questions about process, choices, results, impetus, while at the same time forcing us to think about argument and organization--maybe better stated as narrative--as co-operators in display (or exhibition). The interplay between items and the meanings created by that interplay is really what the exhibit kit wants to foreground, and revealing that interplay as it creates metaphor, symbolic pattern, metonymic relationships, and builds a larger conversation with items and assumptions of meaning outside the exhibit (intertextuality). As a whole, the Exhibit Kit will, hopefully, provide a foundation for both understanding the arguments implicit in the decisions we make about representation through figurative language, and allow the building of stories or arguments as fundamental underpinnings to the exhibits the kits produce. The mechanics of figurative language, its augments and narrative interplay will, in effect, be exhibited or rendered visible by the process of building (or, with sinister implications, fabricating) an exhibit. 


Busy day! Hey, it's not an archive kit--IT'S AN EXHIBITS KIT!!! Use the games kit as a template:

- Deck of Cards
- Journals -- can we find a few of these? Or make them up?
- hard drives
- laptops
- VR Headsets
- keyboard pieces
- video game titles
- print off letters of Archivist as discrete parts. 
- frames 



- Objects can be displayed discretely or together
- Encourage versions and descriptions (where, what, why?)
- Materials and medium choices
- Scrapbooking tools (cutting, pasting, merging)
- Storytelling based on the archive or on the exibit
- what is the argument of the exhibit--what do you need to display?
- Maybe just include like 8 options for display (frames, plateholders, pins, boards, boxes, jars, books, etc.)
- ephemera, created...
- Build a story of the person, building, event from the exhibit


Exhibit contains 10 digital image filesImage files are appropriately scanned/legibleImage files have proper metadata descriptionsDublin Core metadata standards followedExhibit builder plugin installedExhibit has an Introduction pageIntroduction page contains two class readingsExhibit has Conclusion page
