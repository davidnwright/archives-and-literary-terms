**Note:** This is part I of a series. This is the first of the archive series. There's a board game series and a intersections series too--check the "index" to find out more. 

As with the other kits in this series, I'm not here to engage forcefully with the entrenched theories and practices of archival study--I'll leave that to the experts, many of whom I draw from here. That said, the opportunities for thinking about the archive as a model, or even a physical space, for understanding figurative language, intertextuality, metonymy, synecdoche, and other let's call them second-level literary terms is intriguing. The archive is, within fairly narrow parameters, a collection of media--or records, documentation--providing information about a place, institution, or group of people; or even more simply, the archive is a space where something is held with other things--a collection. This concept of the archive fulfills many of the definitional requirements of the literary terms listed above: it stands in for a whole, its smaller parts are archives within archives, it represents an institution (the university, say), but also a life lived and, it houses numerous media formats and genres--drafts, letters, pictures, diaries, notes, doodles, radio programs, films, and an almost endless array of other materials and documents.

History is brutally difficult to deal with. Not a statement that most individuals would find objectionable, but it's only now becoming so apparent that the compulsion to write it down surfaces. I'm working on an archive; an archive of my grandmother's two journals from 1970 and 1971. The journals themselves are nothing particularly interesting, there's no salacious details, no outing of family secrets. The contents are mostly descriptions of the weather and day-to-day activities, particularly the names of individuals who visited, were met, or had some-kind of crisis. 

Something about documents in here and their livability. 

Something about media and what we mean by the archive

Something about a few key questions this kit is directed to answer
- what is the archive saving and why?
- do we preserve everything? and, how do we organize or decide or find?
- what conditions govern our presentation of the archive? 
- do themes govern that presentation or preservation? Do we preserve only what's important? How do we determine what's important? Who determines what's important? 


I started this little endeavour because I wanted a reason to implement [SCALAR](http://scalar.usc.edu/) {:target="_blank"} and to some extent, so I could better know a woman who died when I was two years old. I know little about her from family stories or otherwise, there are only a few family pictures of her. She was however a painter and many of her paintings have graced the walls of family houses, including my own. 



  
Speaking to how Ereaders enable a collaborative reading of texts, Dennis Tenen notes that in so being,  "The work was preprocessed, in both technical and the social senses of the word, to privlege certain meanings and modes of comprehension" (Tenen 5). It is this move to preprocess that interests me through its connection(s) to the work of archivists who must also preprocess materials. What biases or otherwise does this presupposition suggest or yield? 

Tenen suggests that "Text is irrevocably intertwined with its stratified material contexts" (Tenen 5)

"The word is in the wires" (Dennis Tenen 5)

"Losing sight of the material contexts of knowledge production is politically perilous, because those who own the contexts set the terms of engagement" (Tenen 9). Thinking about this when I think of comparisons between two texts--like Cordell's move with James' "The Real Thing." It is not the writer that owns the context, but often the publisher!

"Devices that 'watch,' 'see,' and 'think' give rise to object-oriented ontology and the Internet of Things. A new generation of objects clamors for participatory intelligence. They claim space in the home, near the hearth. Smart phones, smart lightbulbs, smart thermostats, smart homes, and smart watches enter the networked public sphere in the role of independent agents" (Tenen 10). There's something here about how these devices automatically post things. How they have agency, but perhaps not free will, unless the free will is in the glitch. 

FREE WILL IS IN THE GLITCH 
  

Cox, Richard J. *Personal Archives and a New Archival Calling: Readings, Reflections and Ruminations*. Litwin Books. Duluth, Minnesota, 2008.

"personal archives might be assuming a new importance in society as the technical means for creating, maintaining, and using documents improve and become more cost-effective, and, as individuals and families seek to preserve their old documents, especially traditional paper forms, as a connection to a past that may seem to be in risk of being swallowed up in the immense digital gadgetry in our Internet Age" (Richard J. Cox vii)

"Personal recordkeeping raises a remarkable array of issues and concerns about records and their preservation, public or collective memory, the mission of professional records managers and archivists, the nature of the role of the insitutional archives, and the function of the individual citizen as their own archivist." (Cox vii)
