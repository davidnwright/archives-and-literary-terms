History is brutally difficult to deal with. Not a statement that most individuals would find objectionable, but it's only now becoming so apparent that the compulsion to write it down surfaces. I'm working on an archive; an archive of my grandmother's two journals from 1970 and 1971. The journals themselves are nothing particularly interesting, there's no salacious details, no outing of family secrets. The contents are mostly descriptions of the weather and day-to-day activities, particularly the names of individuals who visited, were met, or had some-kind of crisis. 

I started this little endeavour because I wanted a reason to implement [SCALAR](http://scalar.usc.edu/) {:target="_blank"} and to some extent, so I could better know a woman who died when I was two years old. I know little about her from family stories or otherwise, there are only a few family pictures of her. She was however a painter and many of her paintings have graced the walls of family houses, including my own. 

  
Speaking to how Ereaders enable a collaborative reading of texts, Dennis Tenen notes that in so being,  "The work was preprocessed, in both technical and the social senses of the word, to privlege certain meanings and modes of comprehension" (Tenen 5). It is this move to preprocess that interests me through its connection(s) to the work of archivists who must also preprocess materials. What biases or otherwise does this presupposition suggest or yield? 

Tenen suggests that "Text is irrevocably intertwined with its stratified material contexts" (Tenen 5)

"The word is in the wires" (Dennis Tenen 5)

"Losing sight of the material contexts of knowledge production is politically perilous, because those who own the contexts set the terms of engagement" (Tenen 9). Thinking about this when I think of comparisons between two texts--like Cordell's move with James' "The Real Thing." It is not the writer that owns the context, but often the publisher!

"Devices that 'watch,' 'see,' and 'think' give rise to object-oriented ontology and the Internet of Things. A new generation of objects clamors for participatory intelligence. They claim space in the home, near the hearth. Smart phones, smart lightbulbs, smart thermostats, smart homes, and smart watches enter the networked public sphere in the role of independent agents" (Tenen 10). There's something here about how these devices automatically post things. How they have agency, but perhaps not free will, unless the free will is in the glitch. 

FREE WILL IS IN THE GLITCH


  
  
  

Cox, Richard J. *Personal Archives and a New Archival Calling: Readings, Reflections and Ruminations*. Litwin Books. Duluth, Minnesota, 2008.

"personal archives might be assuming a new importance in society as the technical means for creating, maintaining, and using documents improve and become more cost-effective, and, as individuals and families seek to preserve their old documents, especially traditional paper forms, as a connection to a past that may seem to be in risk of being swallowed up in the immense digital gadgetry in our Internet Age" (Richard J. Cox vii)

"Personal recordkeeping raises a remarkable array of issues and concerns about records and their preservation, public or collective memory, the mission of professional records managers and archivists, the nature of the role of the insitutional archives, and the function of the individual citizen as their own archivist." (Cox vii)
